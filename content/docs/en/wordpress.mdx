## Payment Status Handling

The plugin automatically handles the following payment statuses from MoneyFusion:

- **paid** - Payment successful (order marked as completed)
- **pending** - Payment is being processed (order marked as processing)
- **failure** - Payment failed (order marked as failed)
- **no paid** - Payment not completed (order marked as on-hold)

## Webhook Integration

For automatic order status updates, leave the webhook endpoint in the woocommerce dashboard:

- Webhook URL: `https://your-site.com/wc-api/wc_fusion_pay_gateway`

This ensures your WooCommerce store automatically receives payment status updates.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the gateway:

1. Enable Debug Log in the gateway settings
2. Check the WooCommerce system status logs for any errors
3. Verify your API URL is correctly entered
4. If the payment option is not visible, go to the payment page and enter `[woocommerce_checkout]` in the shortcut section for more information:

<Callout title="Good to know">
  Make sure that the currency is in CFA Franc and that the amount is 200 minimum
  so that all works without any problem.
